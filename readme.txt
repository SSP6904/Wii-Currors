    Wii Cursors v1.0

 ======================

 This cursor set includes 18 hand-crafted (aren't I punny?) Wii-based cursors for your computer. Three of them
 are animated. Several variants are included. I personally prefer using the tilted cursors. These were created due 
 to boredom over the span of a few days. They are FREE, but no selling and claiming as your own. If you like these, 
 spread the word!

 Created and tested on Windows XP.
 All cursors feature (alpha?) semi-transparency, so you won't see unsightly jaggies.
